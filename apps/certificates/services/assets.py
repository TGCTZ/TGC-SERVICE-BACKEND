"""Images embedded in a certificate PDF: the lab's marks, and the QR code.

Everything here returns a ``data:`` URI rather than a path or a URL. That is
what lets ``render_certificate_pdf`` call WeasyPrint without a ``base_url``: the
document carries its own pixels, so it renders identically from a request, a
management command, a test, or a background job, and never depends on
``collectstatic`` having run.

The cost is document size - a few hundred KB per certificate - which is the
right trade for a file that has to be reproducible years later.
