"""Public certificate verification: the page behind the QR code on the paper.

A plain Django view mounted outside ``/api/v1/``, for the same reasons the GePG
webhooks are (see ``apps/billing/webhooks.py``):

1. The URL is **printed on a physical document**. A certificate issued today may
   be checked in ten years, long after ``/api/v2/`` exists. A versioned prefix
   would strand every certificate already in circulation.
2. It is unauthenticated by design. ``DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES =
   [IsAuthenticated]`` fails closed, and reaching around it per view inside DRF
   is exactly the drift that setting exists to prevent. Staying outside DRF
   keeps that guarantee whole.
3. It answers with HTML for a phone camera, not JSON for a client.

What it deliberately does **not** show: the customer. The printed certificate
names no owner, and a public endpoint keyed on a number found on a document must
not turn that number into a way to look people up. Findings describe the stone;
they identify nobody.
