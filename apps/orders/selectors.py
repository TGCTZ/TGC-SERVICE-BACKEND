    collecting their stones cares about the last one, not the first. The same
    reasoning makes a single held or cancelled stone dominate the whole order -
    that is the exception worth surfacing in a list.

    Ordering matters. Identification and billing are checked before stone
    statuses, because both are properties of the order as a whole: a partly
    identified order has no stone to be behind, and an unpaid bill outranks
    every stone sitting at ``billed``.

    An order-level hold or cancellation wins over everything else, since it is a
    decision somebody made about the visit rather than a consequence of work.

    ``apps.billing``, which sits above this module. Callers should
    ``select_related("bill")`` and prefetch stones, or this is a query per row.
