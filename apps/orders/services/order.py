    Reception records only the count. The individual stones, with the type that
    prices them, are identified afterwards via ``add_stone`` - which is what
    stops an order from quietly holding more stones than were handed over.

    A customer arrives one of two ways: ``customer`` for somebody already on
    file, or ``customer_data`` to register them now. Reception meets most
    customers for the first time *because* an order is being received, so
    demanding they exist beforehand would be a step that serves nobody. Creating
    them inside this transaction is what keeps a failed order from leaving an
    orphan customer behind.

    Args:
        customer: The submitting customer, if already on file.
        customer_data: Validated fields for a customer to register now.
        stone_count: How many stones were handed over.

    The one piece of an order's state that is stored rather than derived,

    about the visit. Once set it dominates the derived stage, so the row reads
    as held wherever it appears.

    **Cancelling a paid order is refused.** Money has changed hands and this
    system has no refund path, so a cancelled-but-paid order would be a record
    nobody could act on. Hold it instead and settle the refund outside the
    system, or revoke the certificates if they have been issued.

    Nothing is undone here. Stones keep their own statuses, the bill stays as it
    is, and releasing the hold returns the order to exactly where it was - which
    is the point of a hold as opposed to a deletion.
